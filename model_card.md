# Model Card
Analysis of risks to determine if there are specific aspects of an insured risk that be used to determine if the risk has a higher probability of resulting in a claim.

## Model Description

**Input:** Insurance data set that comprises historical data on insurance policies, with a variety of information about the policyholders, their demographics, past claim history, and other pertinent features. The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/litvinenko630/insurance-claims). After initial run through the model the dataset was pruned to only include the features that contributed to the outcome.
subscription_length The duration for which the insurance policy is active.
customer_age    Age of the insurance policyholder, which can influence the likelihood of claims.
vehicle_age Age of the vehicle insured, which may affect the probability of claims due to factors like wear and tear.
region_code The code representing the geographical region of the policyholder, as claim patterns can vary regionally.
region_density  Population density of the policyholderâ€™s region, which could correlate with accident and claim frequencies.

**Output:** The resultant model produced a classification model

**Model Architecture:** 

In order to focus in the interpretability of the output the model utilises a DecisionTreeClassifier which it run through a grid search.

## Performance

The performance initially was poor, but after pruning and grouping of the source data the whole model runs in a few minutes.

## Limitations

Due to the choice of model the accruacy of the model is not as good as a alternatives, however the objective was interpretability to understand the impact of the features.
